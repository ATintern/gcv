Note, the result genomic context from Glycine max (soybean) Chromosome I contains an inversion. Also, the Global dot plot of Arachis hypogaea (peanut) reveals an inversion not present in the Micro-Synteny viewer. Lastly, the Macro-Synteny viewer reveals that some of the result genomic contexts belong to larger syntenic structures."
