// A micro-track is an instance of Track that represents a slice of a
// chromosome, rather than a chromosome in its entirety. This file provides an
// NgRx reducer and selectors for storing and accessing micro-track data.
//
// There are two types of micro-tracks in the GCV - those derived from the genes
// provided by the user and those similar to the aforementioned. Since the
// entire chromosome for each gene provided by the user is loaded as a Track
// (see ./chromosome.reducer.ts) the micro-tracks for the genes provided by the
// user are derived from their respective chromosome Tracks via a selector and
// aren't explicitly stored by the micro-tracks reducer.
//
// Clustered and multiple aligned versions of the user defined micro-tracks are
// available via selectors. The multiple alignment selector aligns the Tracks
// within each cluster and returns an object containing the aligned tracks and
// an array of consensus sequences - one for each cluster's multiple alignment.
// These consensus sequences are what's used to find micro-tracks that are
// similar to each cluster. The similar micro-tracks found are what's stored by
// the micro-tracks reducer. Similar to the micro-tracks derived from the genes
// provided by the user, aligned versions of the similar micro-tracks are
// available via a selector. In this case, the micro-tracks are pairwise aligned
// to the consensus sequence they correspond to.
