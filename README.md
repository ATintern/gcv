# Genomic Context Viewer
Genomic Context Viewer (GCV) is a web-app that visualizes genomic context data provided by third party services.

This repository contains GCV itself (the client) and a basic server that demonstrates how the RESTful API GCV depends on can be implemented. 

## Running GCV
GCV is a standalone web-app that can be run locally on a personal computer or integrated into a website.
To run GCV locally, open `index.html` in a web-browser.
By default, GCV retrieves data from the [Legume Information System](http://legumeinfo.org/home).
See the wiki for more information on how to retrieve data from other sources, and for instructions on general use.

## Running the Server
The example server is implemented in [Django 1.8.6](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and Python 2.7.
The easiest way to run the server locally is to create a [Python Virtual Environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/).
Once the Python virtual environments is installed, you can create a virtual environment as follows

    virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 venv

You can then activate the environment

    . ./venv/bin/activate

All the server's dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file, which can be used to bootstrap the virtual environment as follows

    (venv) pip install -r requirements.txt

The server is designed to use a PostgreSQL database configured with an extended version of the [Chado schema](http://gmod.org/wiki/Chado_-_Getting_Started).
See the wiki for details on the necessary extensions.

Lastly, the server loads the database credentials and the [secret key](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/settings/#std:setting-SECRET_KEY) from environment variables: `PGNAME`, `PGUSER`, `PGPASSWORD`, `PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, `SECRET\_KEY` .

The server can be run *locally* as follows

    python manage.py runserver

This command should only be used for running a local instance of the server.
See the [Django docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/es/1.9/howto/deployment/) for deployment options.
Note, GCV is configured to retrieve data from the [Legume Information System](http://legumeinfo.org/home) by default.
See the wiki for information on how to retrieve data from your own instance of the server.
